# 🧠 SporeNet CLI

> **Compile once. Run AI anywhere.**  
> The open-source CLI toolchain for turning machine learning models into embedded, hardware-optimized firmware for physical AI systems.

## 🦠 What is SporeNet?

SporeNet is a command-line interface (CLI) and toolchain that lets developers convert their AI/ML models into highly optimized, quantized binaries ready to run on constrained edge hardware like **ESP32**, **STM32**, and **RISC-V microcontrollers**.

Inspired by the portability of WebAssembly and the ease of Docker, SporeNet simplifies the painful process of model conversion, optimization, and firmware integration for **embedded, real-time, physical intelligence**.

## 🚀 Key Features

✅ Upload AI models in TensorFlow / ONNX / PyTorch  
✅ Automatically quantize and convert models  
✅ Compile models to native C++ firmware for devices  
✅ Support for ESP32 (STM32 and Jetson coming soon)  
✅ Generate `.bin` files for easy flashing  
✅ Fully offline toolchain (cloud-free)  
✅ Easy CLI interface, ready for automation  
✅ Roadmap includes OTA updates and multi-device “swarm AI”
