## 🦠 What is SporeNet?

SporeNet is a command-line interface (CLI) and toolchain that lets developers convert their AI/ML models into highly optimized, quantized binaries ready to run on constrained edge hardware like **ESP32**, **STM32**, and **RISC-V microcontrollers**.

Inspired by the portability of WebAssembly and the ease of Docker, SporeNet simplifies the painful process of model conversion, optimization, and firmware integration for **embedded, real-time, physical intelligence**.
